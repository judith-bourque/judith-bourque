### Hi there! 👋 

I study computer science at Université Laval 🇨🇦. My areas of expertise are open data, politics and R.

**What am I up to?**

* 📦 Developping an R package to get data from the MediaWiki Action API
* 📦 Maintaining [clessn/hublotr](https://github.com/clessn/hublotr), an R package for research database access at Université Laval.
* 📘 Maintaining [clessn/memoire-ulaval](https://github.com/clessn/memoire-ulaval), an `.Rmd` template for a master's degree memoire at Université Laval.
